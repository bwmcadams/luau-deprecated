# LUAU
## Brendan W. McAdams <bmcadams@novus.com>

Interfaces for [MongoDB][MongoDB] to be used as a valid input & output for [Hadoop][Hadoop] jobs, with the project focus on support for [pig][Pig] (hence the Luau name; that and I couldn't come up with a terse "Elephant Makes Love To a Pig" joke) queries against [MongoDB][MongoDB] (similar to functionality [Cassandra][Cassandra] recently added)

   [cassandra]: http://cassandra.apache.org "Apache Cassandra Project"
   [mongodb]: http://mongodb.org "MongoDB"
   [hadoop]: http://hadoop.apache.org "Apache Hadoop Project"
   [pig]: http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/ "Apache Hadoop Pig Query Language"
